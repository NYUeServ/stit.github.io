# Assignment #1

## Overview

This project was written with Python 3. The project can be run via the terminal or an IDE.
This project has a focus on the Birthday Parodox. Running `birthday.py`, will ask the user two questions: "How many times should the program run?" and "How many birthdays should be generated during each run?"

`mydate.py` was written as a Python module for use in `birthday.py`.


## Part 1

Within the `mydate.py` file, there are these functions:

* is_valid_month_num(n)
* month_num_to_string(month_num)
* date_to_string(date_list)
* dates_to_strings(date_list)
* remove_years(date_list)
* is_leap_year(year)
* get_num_days_in_month
* generate_date(start_year, end_year)

`birthday.py` generates the amount of dates given by the user. Not counting the year, the program determines the amount of repeated days that were generated. It then prints out an overview of the duplicate findings and the probability (based on the generated dates) that there will be duplicates.
