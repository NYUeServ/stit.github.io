# birthday.py

'''
Using your previously implemented mydate.py as a module, import it and use it to help write birthday.py
In birthday.py, you'll write a simulation by generating random birthdays
The simulation will be an interactive program that asks the user how many trials to runâ€¦ as well as other parameters for generating birthdays for a group of people
The percentage of times that at least one duplicate occurs should be printed out at the end'''
